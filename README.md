## 🌟 Why I Built This

Hi, I’m **Kashish** – a student who hasn’t done BTech, doesn't own a laptop, and still built this web app from scratch using just my phone.  
I built StudySpark because I couldn’t find simple tools that just *work* without distractions or login.

If you’ve ever felt confused, lost, or stuck as a student — this tool is for you.
